# Linear Regression App
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of one variable, called dependent variable, based on the value of another variable, called independent variable. Application is simple and easy to use, and it shows how regression works and how direction coefficient of regression line changes based on number and coordinates of the entered points.

## About analysis
Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis. It is widely used in many different fields, including biology researches, stock market and price changes on the market, behavioral and social sciences, engineering, economy, politics. Reason for this is because many other data related functions, like exponential and logarithmic functions can easily be approximated by linear functions, with least deviation on certain scale of given data.

## How app works
At the bottom left fields user should input expected maximum values of x and y coordinates of expected input data, although this can easily change with the strip below the main window of the app. Beneath those 2 fields, user should write desired 2D data in the following form: (x-coordinate,y-coordinate). The output red linear curve is visible on main window, where user can also choose if he wants to see data coordinates on graph, or x and y-lines of coordinates of data. The procedure can be repeated an unlimited number of times, with a large number of points.

## Authors
App is developed by 4 students of School od Electrical Engineering in Belgrade, as a part of seminar work The least squares method in the course Complexity of algorithms and selected optimization methods. It was also put at website of the course: [Linear regression](http://optimizacija.etf.rs/LR.html)
